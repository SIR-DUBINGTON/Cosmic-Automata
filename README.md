# Cosmic-Automata
Cosmic Automata is a fascinating simulation project that explores the formation and evolution of a universe using cellular automata principles. Inspired by Stephen Wolfram's ideas, this project models complex interactions such as the formation of stars and black holes within an expanding grid of cells.
